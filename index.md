# Synthetic Arabic

This is project to create a constructed language closely tied to Arabic, its phonology, orthography, morphology, vocabulary, and grammar, but to take great liberties with all of these in order to create a very regular and easy to learn modern auxlang.

## Why Arabic

Out of all languages, Arabic has a rich texture to it ununciations that few language seem to match. Every langauge has it's own character and audiotry palletes will differ. Some people make prefere the muted tones of Native American language, others the heavy use of frictives in Slovik tounges and still others the high twangs of tonal Chinese. And yet certain language seem to stand out from the rest, the precision of Japanese, the sultry nasals of French, the musical overtones of Sanskrit and the textured angulations of Arabic. I suppose if I could do anything I wished in the name of linguistic study I would take native mono-tounged familes from of each of these, and perhaps English as well (^Aside, as a native speaker of English, I find I have no ability to makes qualtative judgements about its phonology. I have very little idea if it is particularlly distinct and pleasurable to non-speakers, or rather if it sounds like an afternoon at the zoo.), and have them live toether in isolation to see what langauge their children and there children's children would create naturally.

In addition to the phonological, Arabic has the unique word constructions of Akkadiatic langauges (^I avoid the term *Semitic language* because it is both a misnomer, and because it has undesirable socio-political conotations in the modern world that are a distraction from real Lingutic study.) They use abajads --alphabets without vowels, and words are defined primarily by their constants. For example, *kbt* is the root form for *book* or *to write*. Variations on those three letters give rise to a number of other words all related to books and writing. Although Synthetic Arabic deviates greatly from the many varieties of natural Arabic due Arabic's numerous irregularites and Synthetic Arabic's intent of complete regularity, the same general principles of word formation apply.


## Principles

1. All forms must be highly regular. While some exceptions can be allowed to ensure semblence to the natural language, even these must have broad regularity in themselves. Countless tables of transformation rules is not acceptable to an accetpable interglossa. A few sheets of paper should be all that a student needs to understand the full range of possible forms.

2. Whne trying to detemine hwo regualirize Arabic irregularties, first consult the dialects to see if there is any evolution in the colloquail than can be utilzed. If that does not help, refer back to the ancestrial Akkadian.

3. Inflection will always have a visual cue in the writing system. This means short vowels can never constitue semantic shifts by themselves. They must either transform to long vowels, or be accompanied by affixes or particles. This prevents any confusion in the reading --if a vowel sound in indecipheable without looking it up in a dictionary, it doesn't really matter what the vowel is anyway! **HMM... not sure this rule can really work. May have to rethink this.**


## Phonology

**Phayrelgaized**. Phayrelgaized constants will be marked by a diacritic instead of as separate letters. Even though it will have almost no effect on speech patterns, it will have a significant impact on the orthography. I expect a great deal of backlash on this basis alone. But I think it is a worthwhile improvement to the language. It reduces the abjad to 23 instead of 28 letters.

**Vocalic R**. One distinction that Synthetic Arabic makes is to split the letter `r` into two. One is a vowel and the other a constant. The relation between long `r` and the constant `r` is analogous to long `o` and `w`, long `i` and `y` and long `a` and `?`.

### Vowels

**Short vs Long**. In Standard Arabic the focal distinction betten long and short vowels is their duration --a long vowel is twice that of a short. In Synthetic Arabic the focal distinction is the sound.

The precise duration is still important in Synthetic Arabic for professional and formal speaking. It is not necessary however for colloquial speech. In Synthetic Arabic the sound of the vowels has priority over the length, yet all speakers should make the long vowels endure marginally longer than the short. Thankfully the inherit nature of the long vowels tends to make them longer, and one doesn't have to really even try to make that distinction. 

The primary consequence of this deviation form Standard Arabic is that fatha and alif shift slightly in order to make the auditory quality between the short and long more distinct. 

|       | Short              | Long              |  
|-------|--------------------|-------------------|
| a     | m**a**ll [ʌ] fatha | c**a**t  [æ] alif |
| i     | p**i**t  [ɪ̈] kasra | f**ee**t [i] ya   |
| o     | v**o**te [o̞] damma | b**oo**t [u] waw  |

For British speakers the short-*a* sounds like the *u* in *but*. Most transliterations of Arabic use the letter `u` for the damma, but we use the letter `o`.

**Schwa**. In addition to the three vowels, Synthetic Arabic adds a *schwa*. The long form of schwa is a vocalic-*r*. At least for now (and maybe forever), schwa is only used for newly borrowed words and not any Standard Arabic words.

|       | Short             | Long            |  
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| r     | b**e**t [ə] schwa | b**er**t [ɚ] ra |

Schwa can be marked in the orthogrpahy with a damma dicritic placed *below* the letter. **NOTE: I have read that it is usually makes as `waw` in dialects that support it, though I don't no how they distinguish the `e` sound from `w`?**


## Morphology

### Metathesis

Natural Arabic has many expectional forms to affect pronunciation niceties. These arise from the application of it's grammatical transformations, whether for difficulty in unnunciation or simply enhancments for concision or aesthtics. The various irregular verbs forms, such as germinated, assimilated, hamzated, hollow and defective, make this abundantly clear. Instead of dealing with these on a case by case basis, Synthetic Arabic uses *metathetic transformations* that can be used wherever certain patterns arise. Metathetic transformations come in three types. Optional, encouraged and required.

|       |       |
|-------|-------|
|       |       |
|       |       |

There are few required metastic transformations, and where they do occur it is rather obvious, since some important meaning could be otherwise lost for the inability to clearly pronounce the irregularity.

|       |       |
|-------|-------|
| -iii- | -iyi- |
|       |       |


## Grammar

Synthetic Arabic grammar, like Natural Arabic grammar, uses a set of *transformation rules* to take the base form of a word and modify it to convey variant semantics. The particular transformations that apply to a word may depend on the words *type*. For instance, some rules only apply to verbs, others nouns. Still other rules may only apply to a particular subset of words such as all words with a `w` in them.

**Transformation Precedence**. Every transformation rule has a specific position in the *precedence hierarchy*. The transformation rules must have precedence in order to ensure a regular result, because rules appied in a different order can lead to different outcomes. All rules are place in the same heirarchy regardless of effected word types. If a rule doesn't apply to a given word simply skip it in when applying the order.

### Number

**Plural**. The general transformation rules for plural are always regular. Natural Arabic is chokeful of *broken plurals* that must be memorized, either by rote or thru a swath of phonological patterns. Synthetic Arabic insted uses a very simple formulary driven primarily by the oldest known rule of plural, the Akkadian elongation of the last vowel. If this were the only rule, then plurals would indeed be the epitome of simplicty, but the broken plurals of Arabic have introduced one useful abstract that we wish to preserve. Arabics capability of creating plurals of plurals, albeit limited, and undoubtly a completely unintentional evolution, is quite useful.


    -oom- male plural
    -aat- female plural


| Number       | Base   | Transformation  |
|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| Plural       | CVCVC  | CVCVVC          |


|              |        |                 |
|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| Dimunative   | CVCVC  | CVCVyC          |
|              |        |                 |
| Augmentative | CVCVC  | CVCVyC          |


[TODO] If there are a few patterns that can be used to keep a better semblance to the natural language, we can use those. A few regular forms instead of just one is okay. But no more!

**Dual**. There is no obligitaory dual. Words that we often think of as dual can simply be said in the singluar, such as English's glasses and pants. However the dual can sometimes be fitting and useful to clarify one's meaning.

**Dimunitiave**. Dimunitave means *small*. It is away to convey a slight degree of the root meaning, smallness of the object or quality named, encapsulation, intimacy, or endearment. It can also be used informally to convey affection. Any word can be cast in the dimunative, including verbs.

> *jubal* becomes *jubayl*

**Augmentative**. This is the opposite of dimunative. It expresses greater intensity, often in size but also in other attributes. It can also be used to informally to convey dominance.


### State

**Definite**.

| Base       | Transformation  |
|------------|-----------------|
| CVC        | a(l) CVC        |
| CVCVC      | a(l) CVCVC      |

**Existential Indefinite**.

| Base       | Transformation  |
|------------|-----------------|
| CVC        | u(n) CVC        |
| CVCVC      | u(n) CVCVC      |

**Universal Indefinite**.

| Base       | Transformation  |
|------------|-----------------|
| CVC        | u(l) CVC        |
| CVCVC      | u(l) CVCVC      |

TODO: What about  kul CVC vs kul alCVC and kul alCVVC ?

**Construct**. The construct state is used to refine a selection using another noun. In other words, when a noun is cast to the constructive state the following noun delimits the set of possible references. For example, in English we might say, "clown-car", by which we are specifying a car that is used by clowns at a circus. Such a construction has a tighter relationship than a adjective or an `of` preposition. In effect it forms a single compound word. In English, writers denote this same idea using hyphens, but there is no vocal indication of them in English speech.

| Base      | Transformation  |
|-----------|-----------------|
|           | -at-            |
|           |                 |


### Gender

Gender transforms are strictly optional. To modern sensabilites they have become somewhat archaic. However they can still be very helpful when used with pronouns to narrow the reference. Gender can also be useful in formal settings when polite ettiquite is desirable, e.g. English's use of Mister, Miss, Sir and My Lady.

| Gender   | Base   | Transform |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Male     | -CVC   |           |
| Female   | -CVC   |           |
|          |        |           |

### Case

Case is a function of predicate valency. Verbs are predicates and they take a given number of arguments. One argument for intransitive verbs and two arguments for transitive verbs. Synthetic Arabic also adds three argument verbs called ditransitive verbs. For each of these three there is a case form called the nomative, accusative and dative respectively. Since Natural Arabic does not have a dative case, Arabic speakers must be careful to use the approprate case.

**Nomative Case**. Also called the *subject* in modern lingustics, this is the *natural-analog masculine case*. It designated the the *agent* of action in the *active voice*.

The transformation rules are as follows.

| base   | transform  |
|--------|------------|
| CVC    | CVCu       |
| CVCVC  | CVCVCu     |

**Accusative Case**. The accusative case, also called the *direct object*, is the thing being directly moved when speaking in the *active voice*.

In the English sentence, *Tom threw the ball*, the ball is the patient and therefore the direct object, and would be cast in the accusative.

| base   | transform  |
|--------|------------|
| CVC    | CVCa       |
| CVCVC  | CVCVCa     |

**Dative Case**. Synthetic Arabic deviates from Natural Arabic by spliting the original accusative case into two cases. The dative case will be familar to speakers of Latin and Greek. It is used in a sentence, in the *active voice*, with an object that is a *recepient*. This is the *natural-analog feminine case*.

In the English sentence, *Tom threw Mary the ball*, Mary is the recipient and therefore the indirect object and would be cast in the dative.

| base   | transform  |
|--------|------------|
| CVC    | CVC?       |
| CVCVC  | CVCVC?     |

**Genative Case**. The genative case is the modifier case. It is used to cast adjectives and adverbs and prepositions.

| base   | transform  |
|--------|------------|
| CVC    | CVCi       |
| CVCVC  | CVCVCi     |


### Conjugation

This largest deviation from Natural Arabic is in verb conjugation. Standard Arabic has a very complex conjugation system, that contribues extensively to the difficulty of learning Arabic. It is also the most diviated part of speech in the many dialets of Arabic.

Unlike Standard Arabic, Synthetic Arabic does not conjugate for person nor consequently gender. There really is no reason to do so any longer, as pronouns are a much better way to indicate the subject and objects of a sentence. However, there are special ????????????????????????????

Note that all three vowels in the following transforms are the same vowels in the same order.

| #    | Form               | Meaning                  |
|------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| I    | kataba             | Definitive (dictionary)  |
| II   | ka**tt**aba        | Causative or Intensive   |
| III  | k**ā**taba         | Associative              |
| IV   | 'aktaba            | Factitive and Causative  |
| V    | **ta**ka**tt**aba  | Reflexive                |
| VI   | **ta**k**ā**taba   | Recipricative            |
| VII  | **n**kataba        | Passive Reflexive        | 
| VIII | k**t**ataba        | Reflexive Selfish ?      |
| IX   | ktabba             | Attributive (adjectival) |
| X    | **st**aktaba       | Permissive ?             |

#### Aspect

**Sound**

| Number    | Person | Imperfect   | Perfect     |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Singular  | 1st    | (n)V CCuC   | CVCaC (nV)  |
|           | 2nd    |   tV CCuC   | CVCaC tV    |
|           | 3rd    |   yV CCuC   | CVCaC yV    |
|           |        |             |             |
| Plural    | 1st    |   nV CCuC   | CVCaC nV    |
|           | 2nd    |   tV CCuC   | CVCaC tV    |
|           | 3rd    |   yV CCuC   | CVCaC (y)V  |
|           |        |             |             |

**Weak**

Words with semi-vowels constants (`w` `y` and `r`).



## Pronouns

**Verb Subject Pronouns**. In Synthetic Arabic the subject argreement aspects have been extracted from the verb conjugation and made into a separate pronouns that, if used, stands next to the verb. In the case of the imperfect aspect this pronoun goes before the verb. In the case of perfect aspect it goes after the verb.

| Person | Gender | Singular | Plural   | Dual    |
|--------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| 1st    | Either | ni       |          |         |
|        | Male   | no       |          |         |
|        | Female | na       |          |         |
|        |        |          |          |         |
| 2nd    | Either | ti       |          |         |
|        | Male   | to       |          |         |
|        | Female | ta       |          |         |
|        |        |          |          |         |
| 3rd    | Either | yo       |          |         |
|        | Male   | ya       |          |         |
|        | Female | yi       |          |         |
|        |        |          |          |         |

**Verb Object Pronouns**. As with the subject pronoun, the object pronoun is no longer eclitically attached to the verb. The object pronouns should come after the verb, and after the subject pronoun if it is present.

Arabic speakers will note some important differences between the Synthetic Arabic and Standard Arabic, particularlly in the 2nd person singular. It's is clear from the general expression of feminine in nouns, that the pronouns have undergone *linguistic drift*. And this is easy to understand as it has continued to happen in modern dialects, most of which have removed the distiction of gender in plurals altogether. Synthetic Arabic restores the original `-a` for feminine and `-o` for masculine and innovates the use of `i` for indifference. A modern SA speaker will often use the indifferent form unless specifying the gender is clarifying.

| Person | Gender | Singular | Plural   | Dual   |
|--------|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | Either | ni       | na       | na     |
|        | Male   |          |          |        |
|        | Female |          |          |        |
|        |        |          |          |        |
| 2nd    | Either |          | ku       | kuma   |
|        | Male   | ka       | kum      |        |
|        | Female | ki       | kunna    |        |

|        | Female | ha       | hunna    |        |
|        |        |          |          |        |

**Independent Subject Pronouns**.

| 1st    | Either | ana      | naHnu   | naHnu  |
|        | Male   | ana      | naHnu   |        |
|        | Female | ana      | naHnu   |        |

### Pronominal Possessives

???

Unlike Natural Arabic, the pronomial possesives are written as separate words rather then noun endings, tough their pronunciations may be eclitic (bleed into the word). 

| Person | Base   | Transform  |
|--------|--------|------------|
| 1st    | -C     | -Ci        |
|        | -V     | -Vti       |
|        |        |            |
| 2nd    |        |            |
|        |        |            |
|        |        |            |
| 3rd    |        |            |
|        |        |            |
|        |        |            |



## Participles

Syntehtic Arabic's lexicon of words is very similar to Natural Arabic becuase it utlizes the same tiliteral roots. However it also signifcantly different because it strongly enforces a set of morphological rules. Like Natural Arabic, Synthetic Arabic derives many words from verbs. We call these *participles* (a slight distinction from the traditional use of the term in that these can also be nouns, as well as adjectives and adverbs). Using the proper transformation rules we can construct words that refer to the the nominative case of a verb, the accustative case of a verb, the dative case of a verb, and the verb itself. All of these apply to any form of the verb, so we are able to derive many subtile meaning that are simply not possible in other language, including Natural Arabic.

Any verb can be converted to a noun, and subsquently an adjective or adverb. There are four forms of participle corresponding to the act itself, the nomative case, the accusative case and the dative case.

| Type        | Base   | Transform   |                                         |
|-------------|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Infinitive  | alima  | al'Ilmu     |                                         |
| Nomative    |        | 'aalimun    | One who knows                           |
| Accusative  |        | ma'aluumun  | That which is known                     |
| Hyperbolic  |        | 'allaamatun | One who knows a lot                     |
| Dative      |        |             | (n/a, verb is not ditransitive)         |
| Resemblence |        | aliimun     | One who knows intrinsically             |
| Utilitarian |        | mi'laamun   | Through which we know                   |
| Locative    |        | ma'limun    | Where/when we know                      |
| Comparative |        | a'lamu      | One who knows more (if indefinite)      |
| Suparlative |        | a'lamu      | One who knows the most (if definite)    |

As would be expected, the accusative and dative cases do not apply to intransative verbs, and the dative case does not apply to transitve verbs.

Conjugation is higher in the precedence hierarchy than participle transform, which means any voice, mode, tense or aspect can be carried over to the participle.


## Refinements [Better Name?]

In addition to the participles, words can made plural, as we have seen. Thanks to the cyclic nature of plural system plurals of plurals are possible conveying further layers of meaning. For example, in Standard Arabic the word for libray is *mukatab*, as it is for Synthetic Arabic as well, but SA also has another word for library, ... which literally meaning a collection of a collection of books. Note ... means a colleciton of books, which might also be thought of a library but it means more like a personal library or a compendium of books, like a set of encylopedia. So from this we can see how layered plurals can easily lead to much broard concepts. Keep in my that this doesn't make words like mukatab obselete necessarily, because mukatab stress the the fact that it is a *building* of books by the prefix `mu`, which is a useful distinction.

Besides plural there are a number of other useful noun transformations that mixed and matched can lead to vast range of vocabulary. The wonderful thing about these rules is that it makes it very easy to grasp what a huge selection of words mean just by learning a single root.

Transform rule can be as simple as adding a prefix or a suffix. Some can be more complex, involving the insertion of an infix or a change vowels or constants.
